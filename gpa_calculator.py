Thoughts: 

Make a class for Student 
    would allow for calculating overall GPA 

Make a class for course
    allow for getting gpa quality points for course 

Make a func/class for grades 
    input number of assignments, weight, grade, returns 
    grade for the class, possibly with reference from 
    syllabus to what grade correspond to letter grade

Make globals for past semesters? 
    so that can just be passed in? maybe? 
    or store in some other way
